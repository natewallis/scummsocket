# ScummSocket™️

## Description

An elixir based monkey island parser with lofty goals to extract and parse Monkey Island resources in the browser. 

This code has not been written with the goal of decoding every Scumm game that has ever been written and is purely written to focus on Scumm file format v4 to align with the Monkey Island disk images that I had access to.

## Documentation

Please note:  Codebase currently relies on disk images that are in the repository root and not available via hex, livebook needs to be installed locally at this point in time
